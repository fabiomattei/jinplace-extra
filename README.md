# Extra field editor plugins for jinplace 

This repo holds extra field editors for jinplace.

It is a forum for experimentation and discussion. Any contribution
will be accepted here, no matter how obscure the use-case.

Widely used plugins may be selected for an 'official' extras package or
to be added to the main jinplace package.

## Naming conventions 

All editors will have a name that includes "extra" or "demo" or some
other indication that it is not part of the core jinplace.
A suffix is used to indicate different versions or variations on a
similar editor control.

Words are separated by underscores.

The rules are loose at the moment but may firm up as more are added.
